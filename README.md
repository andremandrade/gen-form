# GenForm

GenForm helps to generate dynamic HTML forms for projects using AngularJS.

## Running the application

If you don't have `bower` and `live-server` installed, you need to run the following commands first:

```bash
npm install -g bower
npm install -g live-server
```

After that, go to the root project folder ( `/path/to/gen-form/` ) and run:

```bash
npm install
bower install
live-server
```

Then open the `http://localhost:8080` URL in your browser and access the folder `examples`.
